# workProduction
Development of a production control system for the company where I work using React, React Native and MongoDB.


## Typescript
The project started with the typescript configuration, a development dependency.


## .editorconfig and .eslintrc.json
So that consistency can be maintained in the project, we configure .editorconfig and .eslintrc.json


## git-commit-msg-linter
For the standardization of commits, git-commit-msg-linter will be used, this will help to correct possible future problems during the development of the project
